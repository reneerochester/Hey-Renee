  %h3 Objective

  %p 
    As a web developer I make it my objective to have a positive impact on clients by using my experience to create effective and maintainable websites. 
    %br In my spare time I like to scour the internet for new tools and resources that will make me wiser and more productive. This does occasionally lead to geek spasms.


#skills

  %h3 Development

  %ul
    %li Ruby on Rails ( I'm currently enjoying haml)
    %li Javascript (I'm great friends with both coffeescript and jquery.)
    %li CSS (I'm loving compass and sass. CSS is finally sane again!)
    %li HTML5 (gotta love that structured classing!)


  %h3 Tools
  %ul
    %li Mac OSX / Ubuntu
    %li Git / Subversion 
    %li Textmate / vim
    %li Heroku
    %li Bash/Shell Mac/Linux

  %h3 General
  %p 
    %br I'm always striving to become a better developer - whether through reading, conversation, or observation of best practices. I've learned a lot since I started - and yet there's still so much to learn.
    %br Other developers are a great source of knowledge and I attend Toronto developer meetups every now and then and I try to stay up-to-date with the constantly evolving technological landscape. 
    %br I enjoy trying out the new capabilities of CSS & New Releases of HTML.
